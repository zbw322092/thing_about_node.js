# bind apply and call methods in Javascript

`bind`, `apply` and `call` are three methods defined on `Function.prototype`. These three methods work similarily and they are all work closely with `this` and context.

Actually, MDN has stated the definition of `bind`, `apply` and `call` methods fairly clear, we quote those definitions here with bold keywords firstly and demonstrate them by examples later.

[`bind()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind):
> The `bind()` method **creates a new function** that, **when called**, has **its `this` keyword set to the provided value**, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.

[`apply()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply)
> The `apply()` method **calls a function with a given `this` value**, and arguments provided as an **array** (or an array-like object).

[`call()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call)
> The `call()` method **calls a function with a given `this` value** and arguments provided **individually**.
